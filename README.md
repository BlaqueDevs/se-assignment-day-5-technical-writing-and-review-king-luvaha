- Conduct surveys or interviews.
- Use analytics to assess prior interactions.
- Provide a brief quiz or self-assessment.
- Analyze questions asked in forums or support tickets.

## Ensuring Accessibility
### 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
- Use simple, clear language.
- Break down steps into easy-to-follow instructions.

- Simplifies abstract concepts.
- Provides a reference point.
- Caters to visual learners.
- Makes content more engaging.

### 8. What types of visuals are most effective for different kinds of technical information?
- **Diagrams** – Workflows and relationships between components.

- **Screenshots** – UI instructions.
- **Infographics** – Summarizing complex ideas.

## Improving Readability and Organization
### 9. How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?
